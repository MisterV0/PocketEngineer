a) on mobile it looks perfect, just one issue, when I open the keyboard and type something, then press the back button from the phone keyboard, not the button on the screen, 
it goes back isntead of closing the keyboard, and we exit the page, this looks like a similar bug to you? can you solve it?
b) cicle, rectangle and square solver are not fitted for mobile devices, either we add a tooltip telling it won't work or we solve the issue
c) create new app for series/parallel 
d) add proper links to other apps + contact links 
e) site map
